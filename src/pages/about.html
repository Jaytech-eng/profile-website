        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>I’m Okoro Johnson, a multidisciplinary professional 
            working at the intersection of technology, academia, 
            business strategy, and consulting. My work is driven by a simple belief: 
            when knowledge is well-structured and systems are well-designed, 
            people perform better and organizations grow sustainably.
            With a foundation in Library and Information Science, 
            I have built, managed, and supported information systems in academic 
            settings, including contributing to the establishment of a 
            school library from the ground up and serving as a teacher-librarian.<br>

            <p>These experiences shaped my analytical thinking, research orientation, 
            and deep appreciation for organized knowledge and digital information access.
            My career has expanded into business and operations management, 
            where I currently lead retail operations within a high-volume 
            commercial environment. This role sharpened my skills in process 
            optimization, leadership, customer experience, and data-informed 
            decision-making. To complement this experience, I am pursuing a 
            Master’s degree in Business Administration (MBA), with a focus on 
            strategic thinking and organizational growth.<br>

            <p>In the tech space, I work as a tech consultant and digital support 
            professional, helping individuals and small businesses navigate 
            technology with clarity—especially beginners transitioning into tech. 
            I also provide virtual assistant and operational support services, 
            bridging the gap between digital tools and business efficiency. 
            As an entrepreneur, I have launched and managed brands across 
            fashion and technology retail, strengthening my hands-on understanding 
            of branding, systems, and market positioning.
            Across all these fields, my strength lies in connecting information, 
            people, and processes—turning complexity into 
            structure and ideas into actionable systems.
